## Dataset Overview
#### Data Subject(s)
- Non-Sensitive Data about people
- Others: Publicly available user-written movie reviews and rating-derived sentiment labels

#### Dataset Snapshot
Category | Data
--- | ---
Size of Dataset | Not specified in the paper
Number of Instances | 50,000 reviews
Number of Fields | Not specified in the paper
Labeled Classes | 2 (positive, negative)
Number of Labels | 50,000 binary sentiment labels (1 per review)
Average Labeles Per Instance | 1
Algorithmic Labels | Binary polarity labels derived by thresholding IMDB scores
Human Labels | Original IMDB review scores / ratings supplied by reviewers
Other Characteristics | Class-balanced; max 30 reviews per movie; neutral reviews excluded; train/test use disjoint movie sets

**Above:** Snapshot of the IMDB review benchmark dataset introduced in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** The paper also mentions using 25,000 labeled IMDB reviews for learning word representations, and a variant using 50,000 additional unlabeled reviews.

#### Content Description
Each instance is a **movie review text** from IMDB paired with a **binary sentiment polarity label**. The dataset is intended for document-level sentiment classification. Labels are based on IMDB review scores: **negative if score ≤ 4/10**, **positive if score ≥ 7/10**. Neutral reviews are excluded.

**Additional Notes:** The paper does not enumerate the exact serialized fields of the released files.

#### Descriptive Statistics

**Above:** Detailed descriptive statistics are not reported in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** Only aggregate dataset-level characteristics are stated.

### Sensitivity of Data
#### Sensitivity Type(s)
- User Content
- Others: The paper does not specify whether usernames, account identifiers, or metadata are included in the released files

#### Field(s) with Sensitive Data
**Intentional Collected Sensitive Data**

(S/PII were collected as a part of the
dataset creation process.)

Field Name | Description
--- | ---
None reported | The paper does not describe collection of direct identifiers or sensitive personal attributes

**Unintentionally Collected Sensitive Data**

(S/PII were not explicitly collected as a
part of the dataset creation process but
can be inferred using additional
methods.)

Field Name | Description
--- | ---
Review text | Free-form user text could potentially contain incidental personal information, but this is not discussed in the paper

**Additional Notes:** Privacy handling is not described in the paper.

#### Security and Privacy Handling
The paper does not report specific privacy filtering, redaction, anonymization, or access-control procedures for the released dataset.

**Method:** Not specified in the paper

**Additional Notes:** Because the dataset consists of public user-generated text, downstream users should review privacy considerations independently.

#### Risk Type(s)
- Not specified in the paper

#### Supplemental Link(s)
**Dataset Page:** http://www.andrew-maas.net/data/sentiment

**Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/P11-1015.pdf

#### Risk(s) and Mitigation(s)
The paper does not provide a formal risk analysis. A likely residual risk is that some free-text reviews may contain incidental personal information or platform-specific artifacts. The paper’s main documented mitigation is **benchmark design** rather than privacy design: using **disjoint sets of movies** for training and testing to reduce leakage from movie-specific correlations.

**Risk type:** Leakage / benchmark contamination risk + mitigated by disjoint movie splits

**Additional Notes:** Privacy and fairness risks are not analyzed in the paper.

## Example of Data Points
#### Primary Data Modality
- Text Data

#### Sampling of Data Points
- Dataset page: http://www.andrew-maas.net/data/sentiment

#### Data Fields
Field Name | Field Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
review_text | Free-form text | User-written IMDB movie review
sentiment_label | positive / negative | Binary label derived from score thresholds
original_score | 1–10 scale (used during construction) | IMDB rating used to derive sentiment polarity; the paper does not explicitly state whether this field is included in the public release

**Above:** Conceptual fields inferable from the paper.

**Additional Notes:** The paper does not print an example review.

#### Typical Data Point
A typical data point is a **single IMDB movie review document** paired with a **binary sentiment label**. Reviews are selected to be **highly polarized**, meaning the underlying IMDB score falls clearly into either the negative or positive range.

```text
{
  "review_text": "[movie review text]",
  "sentiment_label": "positive or negative"
}
```

**Additional Notes:** Example is schematic because the paper does not reproduce a real review instance.

#### Atypical Data Point
Atypical cases are not explicitly cataloged in the paper. Relative to the dataset design, an atypical source review would be a **neutral review** (score 5 or 6), but such reviews are **excluded** from the released benchmark.

```text
{
  "review_text": "[neutral review text]",
  "sentiment_label": "excluded from dataset"
}
```

**Additional Notes:** This describes the exclusion rule rather than an included outlier example.

## Motivations & Intentions
### Motivations
#### Purpose(s)
- Research

#### Domain(s) of Application
`Natural Language Processing`, `Sentiment Analysis`, `Text Classification`, `Representation Learning`

#### Motivating Factor(s)
- To learn word vectors that capture both **semantic** and **sentiment** information
- To exploit abundant **document-level sentiment labels** available in online reviews
- To provide a **larger and more robust benchmark** than smaller prior movie-review datasets
- To reduce train/test correlation caused by multiple reviews of the same movie appearing across folds in earlier benchmarks

### Intended Use
#### Dataset Use(s)
- Safe for research use

#### Suitable Use Case(s)
**Suitable Use Case:** Binary document-level sentiment classification on movie reviews

**Suitable Use Case:** Research on sentiment-aware word representations or feature learning

**Suitable Use Case:** Benchmark evaluation where disjoint movie splits are important to reduce leakage

**Additional Notes:** The paper also uses the data to induce sentiment-aware word vectors.

#### Unsuitable Use Case(s)
**Unsuitable Use Case:** Multi-class rating prediction across the full 1–10 rating scale, because the benchmark excludes neutral reviews and collapses sentiment to two classes

**Unsuitable Use Case:** Domain-general sentiment modeling outside movie reviews without checking transfer performance

**Unsuitable Use Case:** Tasks requiring demographic, author, or rich metadata fields, because such information is not described in the paper

**Additional Notes:** These limitations follow directly from the dataset construction choices stated in the paper.

#### Research and Problem Space(s)
The dataset is intended to support research on **sentiment classification** and **sentiment-aware word representation learning**. The paper specifically motivates the dataset as a more robust benchmark that emphasizes **genuine sentiment features** rather than movie-specific lexical cues caused by overlap between training and test examples.

#### Citation Guidelines
**Guidelines & Steps:** Cite the ACL 2011 paper that introduces the dataset. When relevant, also cite the dataset website listed in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** Disjoint movie splits are used between train and test.

#### Data Processing
**Collection Method or Source**

**Description:** The authors construct a balanced sentiment dataset from IMDB reviews.

**Methods employed:** Threshold ratings into positive and negative classes; exclude neutral reviews; cap reviews per movie at 30; create disjoint movie sets for train/test; for representation learning, use 5,000 most frequent tokens while ignoring the 50 most frequent terms, do not apply stemming, do not apply traditional stop-word removal, and allow some non-word sentiment tokens.

**Tools or libraries:** Not specified in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** The paper also mentions a training variant with 50,000 additional unlabeled reviews.

### Collection Criteria
#### Data Selection
- **Collection Method of Source:** Select IMDB movie reviews with no more than 30 reviews per movie
- **Collection Method of Source:** For benchmark classification, include only highly polarized reviews
- **Collection Method of Source:** Use disjoint movie sets for training and testing

**Additional Notes:** These are the main documented criteria.

#### Data Inclusion
- **Collection Method of Source:** Include reviews with score **≤ 4/10** as negative
- **Collection Method of Source:** Include reviews with score **≥ 7/10** as positive
- **Collection Method of Source:** Include an even number of positive and negative reviews

**Additional Notes:** The released benchmark is balanced.

#### Data Exclusion
- **Collection Method of Source:** Exclude neutral reviews (scores 5 or 6)
- **Collection Method of Source:** Exclude reviews beyond the per-movie cap of 30
- **Collection Method of Source:** Avoid movie overlap between training and test sets

**Additional Notes:** These exclusions are central to the paper’s benchmark design.

### Relationship to Source
#### Use & Utility(ies)
- **Source Type:** IMDB reviews are used to build a benchmark for sentiment classification and to provide document-level supervision for sentiment-aware word vector learning

**Additional Notes:** The source platform supplies both free-text reviews and review scores.

#### Benefit and Value(s)
- **Source Type:** Larger than the 2,000-review Pang and Lee benchmark
- **Source Type:** Reduced train/test contamination through disjoint movie splits

--- | --- | ---
Count | Not specified | Not specified

**Above:** No human-attribute distributions are reported in the paper.
**Additional Notes:** None.

#### Known Correlations
[`review_text`]

**Description:** The paper discusses **movie-specific lexical correlation** as a benchmark concern in earlier datasets, not demographic correlation.

**Impact on dataset use:** Disjoint movie splits are used to reduce memorization of movie-specific words.

**Additional Notes:** This is the only explicitly discussed correlation risk.

#### Risk(s) and Mitigation(s)
**Human Attribute**

The paper does not discuss fairness or demographic risk analysis.

## Extended Use
### Use with Other Data
#### Safety Level
- Unknown

#### Known Safe Dataset(s) or Data Type(s)
**Dataset or Data Type:** Not specified in the paper.

#### Best Practices
Use the dataset primarily as a **standalone benchmark** for sentiment classification unless there is a clearly justified reason to join it with other data.

**Additional Notes:** The paper does not provide data-joining guidance.

#### Known Unsafe Dataset(s) or Data Type(s)
**Dataset or Data Type:** Not specified in the paper.

#### Limitation(s) and Recommendation(s)
The paper does not discuss joining with other datasets. Because the data are free-text reviews, joining with author or account metadata could change the privacy and leakage profile.

**Additional Notes:** This is a downstream-use recommendation, not a statement from the paper.

### Forking & Sampling
#### Safety Level
- Conditionally safe to fork and/or sample

#### Acceptable Sampling Method(s)
- Random Sampling
- Stratified Sampling

#### Best Practice(s)
Maintain **class balance** and, when possible, preserve **movie-level disjointness** between train and test partitions.

**Additional Notes:** These recommendations follow the paper’s benchmark design logic.

#### Risk(s) and Mitigation(s)
Sampling that ignores movie identity may reintroduce benchmark leakage through movie-specific words.

**Risk Type:** Train/test contamination risk + mitigate by grouping/splitting at the movie level

**Additional Notes:** None.

#### Limitation(s) and Recommendation(s)
The benchmark is intentionally designed to prevent memorization of movie-specific lexical cues. Any fork or sample that breaks this constraint may inflate performance.

**Limitation Type:** Split design + preserve disjoint movie sets where possible

**Additional Notes:** None.

### Use in ML or AI Systems
#### Dataset Use(s)
- Training
- Testing
- Validation

#### Notable Feature(s)
**Exploration Demo:** Dataset page listed in the paper.

**Notable Field Name:** Sentiment label is binary and derived from highly polarized scores only.

**Notable Field Name:** Dataset is balanced across positive and negative classes.

**Notable Field Name:** Training and test sets use disjoint movie sets.

**Above:** These are the main benchmark characteristics emphasized in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** The paper also uses 10-fold cross-validation on other datasets for comparison.

#### Usage Guideline(s)
**Usage Guidelines:** Use as a benchmark for document-level sentiment classification and sentiment-aware representation learning. Preserve the documented split logic and note that the task is binary polarity classification, not full-scale rating prediction.

**Approval Steps:** Not specified in the paper.

**Reviewer:** Not specified in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** None.

#### Distribution(s)
Set | Number of data points
--- | ---
Train | 25,000
Test | 25,000
Validation | Not separately provided in the paper
Dev | Not separately provided in the paper

**Above:** Official split information explicitly stated in the paper.

**Additional Notes:** Hyperparameters were cross-validated on the training set.

#### Known Correlation(s)
`movie identity`, `review_text`

**Description:** Earlier smaller benchmarks contained correlated reviews from the same movie across train/test folds. The new IMDB dataset is designed to avoid this issue.

**Impact on dataset use:** Reported results better reflect genuine sentiment generalization rather than memorization of movie-specific words.

**Risks from correlation:** Breaking the disjoint-by-movie split can inflate performance estimates.

**Additional Notes:** This is a central motivation in the paper.

#### Split Statistics
Statistic | Train | Test | Valid | Dev
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Count | 25,000 | 25,000 | Not specified | Not specified
Class balance | Balanced positive/negative | Balanced positive/negative | Not specified | Not specified
Movie overlap | Disjoint from test | Disjoint from train | Not specified | Not specified

**Above:** Split statistics directly supported by the paper.

#### Additional Considerations
Not specified in the paper.

#### Others (Please Specify)
The paper explicitly describes the following dataset-construction transformations:
- Thresholding review scores into positive/negative labels
- Excluding neutral reviews
- Capping reviews per movie at 30
- Enforcing disjoint movie sets between train and test
- Restricting vocabulary for representation learning experiments

#### Method(s) Used
Rule-based filtering and thresholding, as described in the paper.

#### Comparative Summary
These transformations are used to create a more robust sentiment benchmark and reduce leakage from movie-specific overlap.

#### Residual & Other Risk(s)
A stricter benchmark may reduce ecological validity for real-world rating distributions because neutral reviews are excluded.

#### Human Oversight Measure(s)
Not specified in the paper.

#### Additional Considerations
None.

## Annotations & Labeling
#### Annotation Workforce Type
- Human Annotations (Non-Expert)
- Machine-Generated Annotations

#### Annotation Characteristic(s)
**Annotation Type** | **Number**
--- | ---
Number of unique annotations | 50,000 review-level labels
Total number of annotations | 50,000
Average annotations per example | 1
Number of annotators per example | 1 reviewer-provided rating per included review (as implied by the source platform)
Quality metrics | Not specified in the paper

**Above:** Annotation information inferable from IMDB review ratings and the paper’s label-derivation rules.

**Additional Notes:** Binary labels are derived from original user scores.

#### Annotation Description(s)
**(Rating-derived polarity labels)**

**Description:** Original IMDB review scores are used to derive sentiment labels. Reviews with score **≤ 4** are treated as negative and reviews with score **≥ 7** are treated as positive. Neutral reviews are excluded.

**Link:** http://www.andrew-maas.net/data/sentiment

**Platforms, tools, or libraries:**
- IMDB: source of public ratings and review text
- Label derivation rules: described in the paper

**Additional Notes:** The paper also maps ratings to [0,1] for the sentiment component of model training.

#### Annotation Distribution(s)
**Annotation Type** | **Number**
--- | ---
Positive reviews | 25,000 (50%)
Negative reviews | 25,000 (50%)

**Above:** The released benchmark is class balanced.

**Additional Notes:** Exact train/test class counts are not separately enumerated, but the dataset is evenly divided and class-balanced overall.

#### Annotation Task(s)
**(Sentiment labeling)**

**Task description:** Assign document-level sentiment polarity to movie reviews using user-provided IMDB ratings.

**Task instructions:** Negative if score ≤ 4/10; positive if score ≥ 7/10; exclude neutral reviews.

**Methods used:** Rule-based thresholding of original ratings.

**Inter-rater adjudication policy:** Not specified in the paper.

**Golden questions:** Not specified in the paper.

**Additional notes:** None.

### Human Annotators
#### Annotator Description(s)
**(Rating source users)**

**Task type:** Original rating of movie reviews on IMDB

**Number of unique annotators:** Not specified in the paper

**Expertise of annotators:** Non-expert public users / reviewers

**Description of annotators:** IMDB reviewers who wrote the source reviews and supplied the underlying scores

**Language distribution of annotators:** Not specified in the paper

**Geographic distribution of annotators:** Not specified in the paper

**Summary of annotation instructions:** Not specified in the paper

**Summary of gold questions:** Not specified in the paper

**Annotation platforms:** IMDB

**Additional Notes:** The dataset creators derive labels from these ratings; they do not report a separate manual annotation campaign.

#### Annotator Task(s)
**(User-provided rating task)**

**Task description:** Submit a movie review and corresponding score on IMDB.

**Task instructions:** Not specified in the paper

**Compensation:** Not specified in the paper

**Quality assurance:** Not specified in the paper

**Additional Notes:** None.
